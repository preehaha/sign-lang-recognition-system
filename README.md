Sign Language Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network Based on VGG-16 Deep Learning Approach

Used 12320 images of different classes having character A-Z and 0-9. We have taken 8624 images for training and 3696 images for validation. The VGG-16 model of CNN is a pretrained model that extracts the feature and transfers low level features like edges, rotation, corners and helps learn new features specific to the other 
target problem faced during the classification of images in the dataset sample. Acheived accuracy of 98%.
